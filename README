My first MaxxMSP External, this object uses the Euclidean algorithm to determine the 
Greatest Common Divisor between two integers. I really just made it to get my feet 
wet with writing externals, but it may come of use for algorithmic composition so 
I figured Iâ€™d post it. Make sure you have a dev environment set up according to Max5's API
before trying to build. Also, this was built using XCode 3, I haven't tested building it
with XCode 4 yet.
